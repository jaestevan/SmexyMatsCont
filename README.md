## Continued

This addon was originally created by [LunixiaLIVE](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/smexymats), I am maintaining it after discontinuation by original author before TWW launch.

## Configuration

/sm - brings up the interface options within the blizzard ui. These settings are saved and stored for later.

## Dependencies

ACE is required for this addon to function and installs when this addon installs.

I have included ACE as a dependency addon instead of copying all of the modules needed into SmexyMats.

## How does it work?

Mouse over an item. Hold the "alt" button to see which alts can use said item.

Works with the auction house, dungeon journal, bags, bank, guild bank.

Instead of having to look up an item or memorize item level ranges or names, this lightweight addon does the trick. Just put your mouse over the item and see the notation in the tooltip.

## Works for

- Items/Materials FOR professions.
- Items/Materials FROM professions.
- Gear: Lists expansion and item ID.


## Timewalking Gear:
Equipment from timewalking dungeons will display the expansion they came from even though the item level is timewarped.
